abstract = {An interlingua is a notation for representing the content of a text that abstracts away from the characteristics of the language itself and focuses on the meaning (semantics) alone. Interlinguas are typically used as pivot representations in machine translation, allowing the contents of a source text to be generated in many different target languages. Because of the complexities involved, few interlinguas are more than demonstration prototypes, and only one has been used in a commercial MT system. In this article, we define the components of an interlingua and the principal issues faced by designers and builders of interlinguas and interlingua MT systems, illustrating with examples from operational systems and research prototypes. We discuss current efforts to annotate texts with interlingua-based information.},

For some categories (for example, birds) verification was faster when the target category was a direct superordinate (bird) than a higher level superordinate (animal), while for another category (mammal) this finding reversed. Experiment II obtained ratings of semantic distance that accounted for the previously obtained verification results. Multidimensional scaling of the ratings suggested that semantic distance could be represented as Euclidean distance in a semantic space. Experiments III and IV indicated that semantic distance could predict RTs in another categorization task and choices in an analogies task. These results place constraints on a theory of semantic memory.},

abstract = {Many NLP applications entail that texts are classified based on their semantic distance (how similar or different the texts are). For example, comparing the text of a new document to that of documents of known topics can help identify the topic of the new text. Typically, a distributional distance is used to capture the implicit semantic distance between two pieces of text. However, such approaches do not take into account the semantic relations between words. In this article, we introduce an alternative method of measuring the semantic distance between texts that integrates distributional information and ontological knowledge within a network flow formalism. We first represent each text as a collection of frequency-weighted concepts within an ontology. We then make use of a network flow method which provides an efficient way of explicitly measuring the frequency-weighted ontological distance between the concepts across two texts. We evaluate our method in a variety of NLP tasks, and find that it performs well on two of three tasks. We develop a new measure of semantic coherence that enables us to account for the performance difference across the three data sets, shedding light on the properties of a data set that lends itself well to our method.},

Its design is inspired by current psycholinguistic and computational theories of human lexical memory. English nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are organized into synonym sets, each representing one underlying lexicalized concept. Different relations link the synonym sets. The purpose of this volume is twofold. First, it discusses the design of WordNet and the theoretical motivations behind it. Second, it provides a survey of representative applications, including word sense identification, information retrieval, selectional preferences of verbs, and lexical chains.

In particular, the traditional definitions of depth and density as ordinal integer values in the hierarchical structure of WordNet does not always corre- late with human judgment of lexical semantic similarity, which imposes strong limitations on their contribution to an accurate similarity measure. We thus propose several novel defi- nitions of depth and density, which yield sig- nificant improvement in degree of correlation with similarity.

abstract = {Nowadays, there is a growing interest in machine learning and pattern recognition for tree-structured data. Trees actually provide a suitable structural representation to deal with complex tasks such as web information extraction, RNA secondary structure prediction, computer music, or conversion of semi-structured data (e.g. XML documents). Many applications in these domains require the calculation of similarities over pairs of trees. In this context, the tree edit distance (ED) has been subject of investigations for many years in order to improve its computational efficiency. However, used in its classical form, the tree ED needs a priori fixed edit costs which are often difficult to tune, that leaves little room for tackling complex problems. In this paper, to overcome this drawback, we focus on the automatic learning of a non-parametric stochastic tree ED. More precisely, we are interested in two kinds of probabilistic approaches. The first one builds a generative model of the tree ED from a joint distribution over the edit operations, while the second works from a conditional distribution providing then a discriminative model. To tackle these tasks, we present an adaptation of the expectation–maximization algorithm for learning these distributions over the primitive edit costs. Two experiments are conducted. The first is achieved on artificial data and confirms the interest to learn a tree ED rather than a priori imposing edit costs; The second is applied to a pattern recognition task aiming to classify handwritten digits.},

In the present paper, a new distance measure on graphs is proposed. It is based on the maximal common subgraph of two graphs. The new measure is superior to edit distance based measures in that no particular edit operations together with their costs need to be defined. It is formally shown that the new distance measure is a metric. Potential algorithms for the efficient computation of the new measure are discussed.},

abstract = {Graph matching is an essential problem in computer vision and machine learning. In this paper, we introduce a random walk view on the problem and propose a robust graph matching algorithm against outliers and deformation. Matching between two graphs is formulated as node selection on an association graph whose nodes represent candidate correspondences between the two graphs. The solution is obtained by simulating random walks with reweighting jumps enforcing the match- ing constraints on the association graph. Our algorithm achieves noise- robust graph matching by iteratively updating and exploiting the con- dences of candidate correspondences. In a practical sense, our work is of particular importance since the real-world matching problem is made dicult by the presence of noise and outliers. Extensive and comparative experiments demonstrate that it outperforms the state-of-the-art graph matching algorithms especially in the presence of outliers and deforma- tion.},

abstract = {WordNet, an electronic dictionary (or lexical database), is a valuable resource for computational and cognitive scientists. Recent work on the computing of semantic distances among nodes (synsets) in WordNet has made it possible to build a large database of semantic distances for use in selecting word pairs for psychological research. The database now contains nearly 50,000 pairs of words that have values for semantic distance, associative strength, and similarity based on co-occurrence. Semantic distance was found to correlate weakly with these other measures but to correlate more strongly with another measure of semantic relatedness, featural similarity. Hierarchical clustering analysis suggested that the knowledge structure underlying semantic distance is similar in gross form to that underlying featural similarity. In experiments in which semantic similarity ratings were used, human participants were able to discriminate semantic distance. Thus, semantic distance as derived from WordNet appears distinct from other measures of word pair relatedness and is psychologically functional. This database may be downloaded from www.psychonomic.org/archive/.},

abstract = {Motivated by the properties of spreading activation and conceptual distance, the authors propose a metric, called distance, on the power set of nodes in a semantic net. Distance is the average minimum path length over all pairwise combinations of nodes between two subsets of nodes. Distance can be successfully used to assess the conceptual distance between sets of concepts when used on a semantic net of hierarchical relations. When other kinds of relationships, like `cause', are used, distance must be amended but then can again be effective. The judgements of distance significantly correlate with the distance judgements that people make and help to determine whether one semantic net is better or worse than another. The authors focus on the mathematical characteristics of distance that presents novel cases and interpretations. Experiments in which distance is applied to pairs of concepts and to sets of concepts in a hierarchical knowledge base show the power of hierarchical relations in representing information about the conceptual distance between concepts},

The analysis of these graphs often requires some form of dissimilarity, or distance measure to compare graphs.

To our knowledge, this is the first approach proposed for comparing two graphs containing different numbers of nodes. We derive the conditions under which this dissimilarity measure is a pseudo-metric.

They also proved that the determinant of the distance matrix of a tree is a function of the number of vertices only. Since then several mathematicians were interested in studying the spectral properties of the distance matrix of a connected graph. Computing the distance characteristic polynomial and its coefficients was the first research subject of interest. Thereafter, the eigenvalues attracted much more attention. In the present paper, we report on the results related to the distance matrix of a graph and its spectral properties.},

It combines a lexical taxonomy structure with corpus statistical information so that the semantic distance between nodes in the semantic space constructed by the taxonomy can be better quantified with the computational evidence derived from a distributional analysis of corpus data. Specifically, the proposed measure is a combined approach that inherits the edge-based approach of the edge counting scheme, which is then enhanced by the node-based approach of the information content calculation. When tested on a common data set of word pair similarity ratings, the proposed approach outperforms other computational models. It gives the highest correlation value (r = 0.828) with a benchmark based on human similarity judgements, whereas an upper bound (r = 0.885) is observed when human subjects replicate the same task.},

abstract = {The idea of measuring distance between languages seems to have its roots in the work of the French explorer Dumont D'Urville (1832) [13]. He collected comparative word lists for various languages during his voyages aboard the Astrolabe from 1826 to 1829 and, in his work concerning the geographical division of the Pacific, he proposed a method for measuring the degree of relation among languages. The method used by modern glottochronology, developed by Morris Swadesh in the 1950s, measures distances from the percentage of shared cognates, which are words with a common historical origin. Recently, we proposed a new automated method which uses the normalized Levenshtein distances among words with the same meaning and averages on the words contained in a list. Recently another group of scholars, Bakker et??al. (2009) [8] and Holman et??al. (2008)??[9], proposed a refined version of our definition including a second normalization. In this paper we compare the information content of our definition with the refined version in order to decide which of the two can be applied with greater success to resolve relationships among languages. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we study the problem of approximate graph matching in a large attributed graph. Given a large attributed graph and a query graph, we compute a subgraph of the large graph that best matches the query graph. We propose a novel structure-aware and attribute-aware index to process approximate graph matching in a large attributed graph. We first construct an index on the similarity of the attributed graph, by partitioning the large search space into smaller subgraphs based on structure similarity and attribute similarity. Then, we construct a connectivity-based index to give a concise representation of inter-partition connections. We use the index to find a set of best matching paths. From these best matching paths, we compute the best matching answer graph using a greedy algorithm. Experimental results on real datasets demonstrate the efficiency of both index construction and query processing. We also show that our approach attains high-quality query answers.},

Searching in all semantic relations is an important step in measuring semantic similarity. In this paper, we propose two algorithms, HS (hierarchy spread) and BDOS (bidirection one step), to search the relation with shortest semantic distance in WordNet. HS takes Hyponym and Hypernym into consideration at first, while BDOS searches semantic relations from two start concepts and dealing with all four relations at the same time. Moreover, dynamic threshold is brought in BDOS to control path expansion iteration. After experiments, we make astatistic analysis and comparison between these two algorithms and another approach which is proposed earlier for measuring semantic similarity by researcher named Yang. The experiments show that BDOS gives a better performance and accuracy.},

abstract = {The spectrum of a graph has been widely used in graph theory to characterise the properties of a graph and extract information from its structure. It has also been employed as a graph representation for pattern matching since it is invariant to the labelling of the graph. There are, however, a number of potential drawbacks in using the spectrum as a representation of a graph. Firstly, more than one graph may share the same spectrum. It is well known, for example, that very few trees can be uniquely specified by their spectrum. Secondly, the spectrum may change dramatically with a small change structure. There are a wide variety of graph matrix representations from which the spectrum can be extracted. Among these are the adjacency matrix, combinatorial Laplacian, normalised Laplacian and unsigned Laplacian. Spectra can also be derived from the heat kernel matrix and path length distribution matrix. The choice of matrix representation clearly has a large effect on the suitability of spectrum in a number of pattern recognition tasks. In this paper we investigate the performance of the spectra as a graph representation in a variety of situations. Firstly, we investigate the cospectrality of the various matrix representations over large graph and tree sets, extending the work of previous authors. We then show that the Euclidean distance between spectra tracks the edit distance between graphs over a wide range of edit costs, and we analyse the accuracy of this relationship. We then use the spectra to both cluster and classify the graphs and demonstrate the effect of the graph matrix formulation on error rates. These results are produced using both synthetic graphs and trees and graphs derived from shape and image data. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This book describes the main objective of EuroWordNet, which is the building of a multilingual database with lexical semantic networks or wordnets for several European languages. Each wordnet in the database represents a language-specific structure due to the unique lexicalization of concepts in languages. The concepts are inter-linked via a separate Inter-Lingual-Index, where equivalent concepts across languages should share the same index item. The flexible multilingual design of the database makes it possible to compare the lexicalizations and semantic structures, revealing answers to fundamental linguistic and philosophical questions which could never be answered before. How consistent are lexical semantic networks across languages, what are the language-specific differences of these networks, is there a language-universal ontology, how much information can be shared across languages? First attempts to answer these questions are given in the form of a set of shared or common Base Concepts that has been derived from the separate wordnets and their classification by a language-neutral top-ontology. These Base Concepts play a fundamental role in several wordnets. Nevertheless, the database may also serve many practical needs with respect to (cross-language) information retrieval, machine translation tools, language generation tools and language learning tools, which are discussed in the final chapter. The book offers an excellent introduction to the EuroWordNet project for scholars in the field and raises many issues that set the directions for further research in semantics and knowledge engineering.},

abstract = {This paper gives a global introduction to the aims and objectives of the EuroWordNet project, and it provides a general framework for the other papers in this volume. EuroWordNet is an EC project that develops a multilingual database with wordnets in several European languages, structured along the same lines as the Princeton WordNet. Each wordnet represents an autonomous structure of language-specific lexicalizations, which are interconnected via an Inter-Lingual-Index. The wordnets are built at different sites from existing resources, starting from a shared level of basic concepts and extended top-down. The results will be publicly available and will be tested in cross-language information retrieval applications.},
