abstract = {In 1971, Graham and Pollack established a relationship between the number of negative eigenvalues of the distance matrix and the addressing problem in data communication systems. They also proved that the determinant of the distance matrix of a tree is a function of the number of vertices only. Since then several mathematicians were interested in studying the spectral properties of the distance matrix of a connected graph. Computing the distance characteristic polynomial and its coefficients was the first research subject of interest. Thereafter, the eigenvalues attracted much more attention. In the present paper, we report on the results related to the distance matrix of a graph and its spectral properties.},

abstract = {Nowadays, there is a growing interest in machine learning and pattern recognition for tree-structured data. Trees actually provide a suitable structural representation to deal with complex tasks such as web information extraction, RNA secondary structure prediction, computer music, or conversion of semi-structured data (e.g. XML documents). Many applications in these domains require the calculation of similarities over pairs of trees. In this context, the tree edit distance (ED) has been subject of investigations for many years in order to improve its computational efficiency. However, used in its classical form, the tree ED needs a priori fixed edit costs which are often difficult to tune, that leaves little room for tackling complex problems. In this paper, to overcome this drawback, we focus on the automatic learning of a non-parametric stochastic tree ED. More precisely, we are interested in two kinds of probabilistic approaches. The first one builds a generative model of the tree ED from a joint distribution over the edit operations, while the second works from a conditional distribution providing then a discriminative model. To tackle these tasks, we present an adaptation of the expectation–maximization algorithm for learning these distributions over the primitive edit costs. Two experiments are conducted. The first is achieved on artificial data and confirms the interest to learn a tree ED rather than a priori imposing edit costs; The second is applied to a pattern recognition task aiming to classify handwritten digits.},

In this paper, we propose two algorithms, HS (hierarchy spread) and BDOS (bidirection one step), to search the relation with shortest semantic distance in WordNet. HS takes Hyponym and Hypernym into consideration at first, while BDOS searches semantic relations from two start concepts and dealing with all four relations at the same time. Moreover, dynamic threshold is brought in BDOS to control path expansion iteration. After experiments, we make astatistic analysis and comparison between these two algorithms and another approach which is proposed earlier for measuring semantic similarity by researcher named Yang.

Recent work on the computing of semantic distances among nodes (synsets) in WordNet has made it possible to build a large database of semantic distances for use in selecting word pairs for psychological research. The database now contains nearly 50,000 pairs of words that have values for semantic distance, associative strength, and similarity based on co-occurrence. Semantic distance was found to correlate weakly with these other measures but to correlate more strongly with another measure of semantic relatedness, featural similarity. Hierarchical clustering analysis suggested that the knowledge structure underlying semantic distance is similar in gross form to that underlying featural similarity. In experiments in which semantic similarity ratings were used, human participants were able to discriminate semantic distance. Thus, semantic distance as derived from WordNet appears distinct from other measures of word pair relatedness and is psychologically functional.

He collected comparative word lists for various languages during his voyages aboard the Astrolabe from 1826 to 1829 and, in his work concerning the geographical division of the Pacific, he proposed a method for measuring the degree of relation among languages. The method used by modern glottochronology, developed by Morris Swadesh in the 1950s, measures distances from the percentage of shared cognates, which are words with a common historical origin. Recently, we proposed a new automated method which uses the normalized Levenshtein distances among words with the same meaning and averages on the words contained in a list. Recently another group of scholars, Bakker et??al. (2009) [8] and Holman et??al. (2008)??[9], proposed a refined version of our definition including a second normalization. In this paper we compare the information content of our definition with the refined version in order to decide which of the two can be applied with greater success to resolve relationships among languages. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {After 3 years of specifying the \{UNL\} (Universal Networking Language) language and prototyping deconverters from more than 12 languages and enconverters for about 4, the \{UNL\} project has opened to the community by publishing the specifications (v2.0) of the \{UNL\} language, intended to encode the meaning of \{NL\} utterances as semantic hypergraphs and to be used as a "pivot" representation in multilingual information and communication \{systems.A\} \{UNL\} document is an html document with special tags to delimit the utterances and their rendering in \{UNL\} and in all natural languages currently handled. \{UNL\} can be viewed as the future "html of the linguistic content". It is only an interface format, leading as well to the reuse of existing \{NLP\} components as to the development of original tools in a variety of possible applications, from automatic rough enconversion for information retrieval and information gathering translation to partially interactive enconversion or deconversion for higher \{quality.We\} illustrate these points by describing an \{UNL-French\} deconverter organized as a specific "localizer" followed by a classical \{MT\} transfer and an existing generator.},

abstract = {The distance Laplacian matrix L(G) of a graph G is defined to be L(G)=diag(Tr)−D(G), where D(G) denotes the distance matrix of G and diag(Tr) denotes the diagonal matrix of the vertex transmissions in G. Similarly, the distance signless Laplacian matrix of G is defined as Q(G)=diag(Tr)+D(G). The eigenvalues of L(G) and Q(G) are called the distance Laplacian and distance signless Laplacian eigenvalues, respectively. In this paper, four conjectures proposed by M. Aouchche and P. Hansen about the largest and the second largest distance Laplacian eigenvalues and the second largest distance signless Laplacian eigenvalue of a graph are proved.},

This work is the outcome of the analysis of different international standards that were innovative in Internet and the area of software. Consequently, some criteria have been extracted, considered important for the assessment of the state of maturity of the UNL technology as standard},

abstract = {Many NLP applications entail that texts are classified based on their semantic distance (how similar or different the texts are). For example, comparing the text of a new document to that of documents of known topics can help identify the topic of the new text. Typically, a distributional distance is used to capture the implicit semantic distance between two pieces of text. However, such approaches do not take into account the semantic relations between words. In this article, we introduce an alternative method of measuring the semantic distance between texts that integrates distributional information and ontological knowledge within a network flow formalism. We first represent each text as a collection of frequency-weighted concepts within an ontology. We then make use of a network flow method which provides an efficient way of explicitly measuring the frequency-weighted ontological distance between the concepts across two texts. We evaluate our method in a variety of NLP tasks, and find that it performs well on two of three tasks. We develop a new measure of semantic coherence that enables us to account for the performance difference across the three data sets, shedding light on the properties of a data set that lends itself well to our method.},

abstract = {We re-investigate the rationale for and the ef- fectiveness of adopting the notions of depth and density in WordNet-based semantic sim- ilarity measures. We show that the intuition for including these notions inWordNet-based similarity measures does not always stand up to empirical examination. In particular, the traditional definitions of depth and density as ordinal integer values in the hierarchical structure of WordNet does not always corre- late with human judgment of lexical semantic similarity, which imposes strong limitations on their contribution to an accurate similarity measure. We thus propose several novel defi- nitions of depth and density, which yield sig- nificant improvement in degree of correlation with similarity. When used inWordNet-based semantic similarity measures, the new defini- tions consistently improve performance on a task of correlating with human judgment.},

We propose a general framework using eigendecomposition of graph Laplacians. We show its special cases and propose a new dissimilarity measure that avoid problems of spectral analysis.

The dissimilarity provides an efficient and intuitive tool for graph analysis.},

@article{Wilson2008,
abstract = {The spectrum of a graph has been widely used in graph theory to characterise the properties of a graph and extract information from its structure. It has also been employed as a graph representation for pattern matching since it is invariant to the labelling of the graph. There are, however, a number of potential drawbacks in using the spectrum as a representation of a graph. Firstly, more than one graph may share the same spectrum. It is well known, for example, that very few trees can be uniquely specified by their spectrum. Secondly, the spectrum may change dramatically with a small change structure. There are a wide variety of graph matrix representations from which the spectrum can be extracted. Among these are the adjacency matrix, combinatorial Laplacian, normalised Laplacian and unsigned Laplacian. Spectra can also be derived from the heat kernel matrix and path length distribution matrix. The choice of matrix representation clearly has a large effect on the suitability of spectrum in a number of pattern recognition tasks. In this paper we investigate the performance of the spectra as a graph representation in a variety of situations. Firstly, we investigate the cospectrality of the various matrix representations over large graph and tree sets, extending the work of previous authors. We then show that the Euclidean distance between spectra tracks the edit distance between graphs over a wide range of edit costs, and we analyse the accuracy of this relationship. We then use the spectra to both cluster and classify the graphs and demonstrate the effect of the graph matrix formulation on error rates. These results are produced using both synthetic graphs and trees and graphs derived from shape and image data. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The increasing popularity of graph data in various domains has lead to a renewed interest in developing efficient graph matching techniques, especially for processing large graphs. In this paper, we study the problem of approximate graph matching in a large attributed graph. Given a large attributed graph and a query graph, we compute a subgraph of the large graph that best matches the query graph. We propose a novel structure-aware and attribute-aware index to process approximate graph matching in a large attributed graph. We first construct an index on the similarity of the attributed graph, by partitioning the large search space into smaller subgraphs based on structure similarity and attribute similarity. Then, we construct a connectivity-based index to give a concise representation of inter-partition connections. We use the index to find a set of best matching paths. From these best matching paths, we compute the best matching answer graph using a greedy algorithm. Experimental results on real datasets demonstrate the efficiency of both index construction and query processing. We also show that our approach attains high-quality query answers.},
